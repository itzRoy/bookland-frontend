Evie traded academics to pursue alien conspiracy theories, always looking for Jakob.When Evie's UFO network uncovers a new event, she goes to investigate. And discovers Jakob is back. He's different—older, stranger,and talking of an intergalactic war—but the tensions between the siblings haven't changed at all. ",
